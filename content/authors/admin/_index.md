I am graduate student at the department of [Economics](http://economics.emory.edu/home/index.html)  at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/). I started in the program the Fall semester of 2017. Originally, I come from Quito-Ecuador. I obtained my Bachelor degree at [PUCE](https://www.puce.edu.ec/). I spend several years working on policy research in several public institutions in my home country: [SRI](https://cef.sri.gob.ec/),[INEC](https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/institucional/home/), [Instituto de la Ciudad](https://www.institutodelaciudad.com.ec/). After that I moved to Atlanta, to continue my studies. My area of work is Econometrics, with focus on Networks.
